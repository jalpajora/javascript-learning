## Closures

- a function that has access to it's lexical scope, which includes it's own scope, parent's scope and global scope
- a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function
- closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

## Examples:

1. Callback functions
2. Inner functions
3. Functions with inner code accessing to global variables or functions
